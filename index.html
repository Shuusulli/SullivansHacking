      <h2>ROOT@SULLI</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my personal blog, I'm Sullivan, 27 years old, from Barcelona.
        Network and systems engineer, with a wide range of knowledge in
        programming and cybersecurity. Currently, I work for Gram Group, as a
        network and systems technician. The purpose of this blog is more of a
        hobby, to upload my writeups and see the progress I make.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other things that may interest you about me is that I speak four
        languages, French, Spanish, Catalan and English. The last one being the
        one I speak the least, hence the idea of running the blog in English.
        Maybe I will also put it in the other languages, I'll see how much free
        time I have.
